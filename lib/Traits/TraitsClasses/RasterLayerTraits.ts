This property is true by default, leading to better performance and avoiding tile request errors that might occur when requesting tiles outside the server-specified rectangle.
However, it may also cause features to be cut off in some cases, such as if a server reports an extent that does not take into account that the representation of features sometimes require a larger spatial extent than the features themselves.
For example, if a point feature on the edge of the extent is drawn as a circle with a radius of 5 pixels, half of that circle will be cut off.`
