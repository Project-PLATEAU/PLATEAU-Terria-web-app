*Region mapping* is the process of matching a value in a CSV file to a pre-defined boundary, such as a postcode, local government area or electorate. The allowed boundaries for a given TerriaJS instance are given in a file such as `wwwroot/data/regionMapping.json`.

The current method to create a new set of boundaries not currently recognised by TerriaJS is detailed in [this repository](https://github.com/TerriaJS/boundary-tiles). You'll find instructions there to create new region mapping boundaries using a zipped shapefile or GeoJSON file as well as instructions you can follow to host the vector tiles on Amazon Web Services in an S3 bucket + CloudFront, but any static file hosting service will work.
