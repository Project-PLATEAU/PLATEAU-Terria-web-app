[TerriaJS](http://terria.io) is an open-source framework for web-based geospatial catalog explorers.

The documentation on this site is for applications using TerriaJS version 8. If you are still maintaining an application using TerriaJS version 7 or lower go to [docs-v7.terria.io](https://docs-v7.terria.io).

**Most of these docs were written for TerriaJS version <= 7. We're working on updating these docs, however it will take us some time. For the time being these parts are probably the most useful:**

* [Migration Guide](contributing/migration-guide.md): A migration guide for map builders who maintain a version 7 map and wish to upgrade.
* [v8 Catalog Items](connecting-to-data/catalog-items.md): Generated documentation on all version 8 Catalog Items.
* [v8 Catalog Groups](connecting-to-data/catalog-groups.md): Generated documentation on all version 8 Catalog Groups.
* [v8 Catalog Functions](connecting-to-data/catalog-functions.md): Generated documentation on all version 8 Catalog Function.
* [Getting Started](getting-started.md): Quick start guide to building your first TerriaJS application. Updated for version 8.
* [Deploying](deploying/README.md): Deploy a TerriaJS application in simple and advanced scenarios. Updated for version 8.
* [Frontend Style Guide](contributing/frontend-style-guide.md): A style guide for writing/updating .jsx/.tsx React views for TerriaJS. Some React components have been updated in accordance to this style guide but many have not yet.

Partially updated docs:

* [Getting Started](getting-started.md): Quick start guide to building your first TerriaJS application.
* [Customizing](customizing/README.md): Configure and tweak a TerriaJS application, including skinning and setting up the catalog.
