      <dct:abstract>The physical climate defines a significant portion of the habitats in which biological communities and species reside. It is important to quantify these environmental conditions, and how they have changed, as this will inform future efforts to study many natural systems. We present the results of a statistical  summary of the variability in sea surface temperature (SST) time-series data for the
waters surrounding Australia, from 1993 to 2013. We partition variation in the SST series into annual trends, inter-annual trends, and a number of components of random variation. We utilise satellite data and validate the statistical summary from these data to summaries of data from long-term monitoringstations and from the global drifter program. The spatially dense results show clear trends that associate with oceanographic features. Noteworthy oceanographic features include: average warming was greatest off southern West Australia and off eastern Tasmania where the warming was around 0.6 C per decade for a twenty year study period, and; insubstantial warming in areas dominated by the East Australian Current but this area did exhibit high levels of inter-annual variability (long-term
trend increases and decreases but does not increase on average). The results of the analyses can be directly incorporated into (biogeographic) models that explain variation in biological data where both biological and environmental data are on a fine scale.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>The annual mean wave energy flux is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
Wave energy flux, or wave power density, CgE, is a measure of the available power in the wave field, calculated as the kilowatts per meter (kW/m) of wave crest width.  CgE is a spectrally derived time-series. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The February mean wave energy flux is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using February data from February 1980 to February 2010.
Wave energy flux, or wave power density, CgE, is a measure of the available power in the wave field, calculated as the kilowatts per meter (kW/m) of wave crest width.  CgE is a spectrally derived time-series. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:description>The June mean wave energy flux is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using June data from June 1980 to June 2010.
Wave energy flux, or wave power density, CgE, is a measure of the available power in the wave field, calculated as the kilowatts per meter (kW/m) of wave crest width.  CgE is a spectrally derived time-series. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The November mean wave energy flux is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using November data from November 1980 to November 2010.
Wave energy flux, or wave power density, CgE, is a measure of the available power in the wave field, calculated as the kilowatts per meter (kW/m) of wave crest width.  CgE is a spectrally derived time-series. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The annual mean wave direction is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
Mean wave direction, Dm, is obtained by averaging the mean wave angle over all frequencies with a weighting function defined by the wave spectrum, and is defined as the direction from which the wave field approaches. Units are in degrees clockwise measured from true north. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:description>The April mean wave direction is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using April data from April 1980 to April 2010.
Mean wave direction, Dm, is obtained by averaging the mean wave angle over all frequencies with a weighting function defined by the wave spectrum, and is defined as the direction from which the wave field approaches. Units are in degrees clockwise measured from true north. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The September mean wave direction is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using September data from September 1980 to September 2010.
Mean wave direction, Dm, is obtained by averaging the mean wave angle over all frequencies with a weighting function defined by the wave spectrum, and is defined as the direction from which the wave field approaches. Units are in degrees clockwise measured from true north. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The annual mean significant wave height is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
Significant wave height, Hs, represents the average height of the upper third of the waves in the wave-field, and roughly corresponds to the mean wave height as described by a trained observer.

      <dc:description>The annual mean significant wave height is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
Significant wave height, Hs, represents the average height of the upper third of the waves in the wave-field, and roughly corresponds to the mean wave height as described by a trained observer. Hs is a spectrally derived time-series, calculated as Hs = 4√m0 , where m0 is the zero-th moment of the wave spectrum. More details can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The May mean significant wave height is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using May data from May 1980 to May 2010.
Significant wave height, Hs, represents the average height of the upper third of the waves in the wave-field, and roughly corresponds to the mean wave height as described by a trained observer. Hs is a spectrally derived time-series, calculated as Hs = 4√m0 , where m0 is the zero-th moment of the wave spectrum. More details can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The September mean significant wave height is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using September data from September 1980 to September 2010.
Significant wave height, Hs, represents the average height of the upper third of the waves in the wave-field, and roughly corresponds to the mean wave height as described by a trained observer. Hs is a spectrally derived time-series, calculated as Hs = 4√m0 , where m0 is the zero-th moment of the wave spectrum. More details can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Hs is a spectrally derived time-series, calculated as Hs = 4√m0 , where m0 is the zero-th moment of the wave spectrum. More details can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The annual mean directionality coefficient is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
The directionality coefficient is the fraction of directionally resolved wave power Jm to the omnidirectional wave power (or total wave power, CgE). An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Note, accurate determination of directionality coefficient and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of directionality coefficient whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate directionality coefficient are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The April mean directionality coefficient is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using April data from April 1980 to April 2010.
The directionality coefficient is the fraction of directionally resolved wave power Jm to the omnidirectional wave power (or total wave power, CgE). An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Note, accurate determination of directionality coefficient and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of directionality coefficient whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate directionality coefficient are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The August mean directionality coefficient is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using August data from August 1980 to August 2010.
The directionality coefficient is the fraction of directionally resolved wave power Jm to the omnidirectional wave power (or total wave power, CgE). An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Note, accurate determination of directionality coefficient and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of directionality coefficient whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate directionality coefficient are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The December mean directionality coefficient is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using December data from December 1980 to December 2010.
The directionality coefficient is the fraction of directionally resolved wave power Jm to the omnidirectional wave power (or total wave power, CgE). An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Note, accurate determination of directionality coefficient and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of directionality coefficient whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate directionality coefficient are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The 10th percentile of directionality coefficient is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
The directionality coefficient is the fraction of directionally resolved wave power Jm to the omnidirectional wave power (or total wave power, CgE). An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

Note, accurate determination of directionality coefficient and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of directionality coefficient whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate directionality coefficient are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The annual mean maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
The directionally resolved wave power propagating in direction 0, J0, can be calculated by resolving the wave power of each component in direction 0. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

J0 is determined at for 0 at 15° intervals, and the maximum directionally resolved wave power, Jm, represents the maximum time-averaged wave power propagating in a single direction.

Note, accurate determination of J0 and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of Jm whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dct:abstract>The April mean maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using April data from April 1980 to April 2010.
The directionally resolved wave power propagating in direction 0, J0, can be calculated by resolving the wave power of each component in direction 0. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

J0 is determined at for 0 at 15° intervals, and the maximum directionally resolved wave power, Jm, represents the maximum time-averaged wave power propagating in a single direction.

Note, accurate determination of J0 and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of Jm whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:subject>Wave Energy Resource | Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power | Monthly Means</dc:subject>
      <dct:abstract>The August mean maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using August data from August 1980 to August 2010.
The directionally resolved wave power propagating in direction 0, J0, can be calculated by resolving the wave power of each component in direction 0. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

J0 is determined at for 0 at 15° intervals, and the maximum directionally resolved wave power, Jm, represents the maximum time-averaged wave power propagating in a single direction.

Note, accurate determination of J0 and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of Jm whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:title>(Month 12) December Mean Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power</dc:title>
      <dc:subject>Wave Energy Resource | Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power | Monthly Means</dc:subject>
      <dct:abstract>The December mean maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using December data from December 1980 to December 2010.
The directionally resolved wave power propagating in direction 0, J0, can be calculated by resolving the wave power of each component in direction 0. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

J0 is determined at for 0 at 15° intervals, and the maximum directionally resolved wave power, Jm, represents the maximum time-averaged wave power propagating in a single direction.

Note, accurate determination of J0 and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of Jm whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:title>10th Percentile of Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power</dc:title>
      <dc:subject>Wave Energy Resource | Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power | Statistics</dc:subject>
      <dct:abstract>The 10th percentile of maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
The directionally resolved wave power propagating in direction 0, J0, can be calculated by resolving the wave power of each component in direction 0. An equation describing its calculation can be found in the the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

J0 is determined at for 0 at 15° intervals, and the maximum directionally resolved wave power, Jm, represents the maximum time-averaged wave power propagating in a single direction.

Note, accurate determination of J0 and Jm require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. These data provide estimates of Jm whereby spectra are reconstructed using archived gridded wave partition data, with a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. For consistency in this estimate, the omnidirectional wave power is determined from the reconstructed spectra, and not the archived CgE presented elsewhere. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).

      <dc:title>Annual Mean Direction of the Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power</dc:title>
      <dc:subject>Wave Energy Resource | Direction of Maximum Directionally Resolved Wave Power | Statistics</dc:subject>
      <dct:abstract>The annual mean direction of the maximum directionally resolved wave power is derived from the CAWCR global wave hindcast, using data from the archived hourly 4’ Australian grid, using data from 1st January 1980 to 31st December 2010.
The direction of the maximum directionally resolved wave power is 0j and is used as the characteristic direction of the sea-state. Note, accurate determination of the directionally resolved wave power, J0, and its maximum, Jm, and hence 0j require spectral data, which was not archived at all grid points of the CAWCR wave hindcast. Here, we provide estimates of Jm using spectra reconstructed with archived gridded wave partition data, assuming a Pierson-Moskowitz spectra fit to each partition, with assumed spreading, and superimposed to produce a reconstructed spectra. Further details of the method used to estimate Jm are provided in the atlas report (Hemer et al., 2016).
