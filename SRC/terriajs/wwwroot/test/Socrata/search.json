        "description": "This dataset includes City of Melbourne’s mapping of greening potential in laneways across the municipality. 'Greening' in this dataset refers to four types of possible greening responses: forest lanes, farm lanes, park lanes and vertical gardens. Higher gridcodes indicate lower potential for adaptation - i.e. a gridcode of 1 is optimal.\r\n\r\nThis dataset can be used the general public, developers, landscape architects and other interested parties who want to know what the future of green laneways may look like for Melbourne. This dataset can be used as a starting point for greening projects including forest, farm and park lanes as well as vertical gardens\r\n\r\nAnyone interested in potential greening within the city should contact the City of Melbourne or visit the Green Infrastructure webpages found on the <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/greening-the-city/green-infrastructure/Pages/green-roofs-walls-facades.aspx/\"> City of Melboune website here</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.growinggreenguide.org/\">Growing Green Guide</a> is another helpful and comprehensive guide for the building and maintaining green roofs, walls and facades in Melbourne and Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe Laneways with greening potential dataset is part of a larger suite of work by City of Melbourne to explore and implement contemporary and unique ways of greening in the city that can help combat increased urban density and loss of public open space. Green laneways are an exciting way to liven up the city, and help residents and visitors to explore Melbourne while also combating increasing threats of stormwater runoff, the urban heat island and biodiversity loss.",

        "description": "This dataset contains environmental readings from microclimate sensors located across the city. The data is updated every hour in fifteen minute increments and can be used to determine variations in microclimate changes throughout the day. Microclimate data includes:\n- Ambient air temperature\n- Relative humidity\n- Barometric pressure\n- Particulate matter 2.5\n- Particulate matter 10\n- Average wind speed\n\nThe Microclimate Sensor Readings helps us to understand temperature, relative humidity, pressure, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10, and average wind speed at different locations and different times of day to better inform decision-making and plan for the future. \n\nAdditional values are included in this dataset to provide an easier way to correlate the data with the official EPA Victoria data. These can be identified with the value 'epa' included in the type column. EPA Victoria report air quality readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages . This includes; ambient air temperature readings in 1 hour average, relative humidity readings in 1 hour average, particulate matter 2.5 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages, and particulate matter 10 readings in 1 hour and 24 hour averages. \n\nThe site_id column can be used to merge the data with the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4' target='_blank'>Sensor Locations dataset</a> which contain the sensor location. Any changes to sensor locations are important to consider when analysing and interpreting historical microclimate data.\n\nNote this dataset may not contain a reading for every sensor for every 15 minutes as the sensor devices might not have a reading for each value. There may be situations where no readings are reported for all sensors or only some readings are reported at a particular site. \n\nFor the description of each sensor please see the <a href='https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/api/views/u4vh-84j8/files/5b981d2b-f137-40d4-9c91-53d7b0504d11?download=true&filename=MicroClimateSensors_Metadata_Attachment_DataDictionary.pdf' target='_blank'>sensor type attachment</a>.\n\nRelated datasets: \n<a href=\"https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Mircoclimate-Sensor-Locations/irqv-hjr4\">Microclimate Sensor - Sensor Locations</a>",

Over 700 citizens participated in 53 events led by 90 volunteer ecologists and experts. It gave Melburnians the unique opportunity to work alongside professional and amateur naturalists to discover Melbourne's biodiversity and help to produce a list of species living in our city.\r\n\r\nThe City of Melbourne has analysed the data collected in past BioBlitzes and is now building a baseline dataset against which future changes in biodiversity can be measured and evaluated.",

A planting schedule for streets in each precinct has been developed in consultation with the community and is based on:\r\n-\tCommunity priorities\r\n-\tLocation and density of vulnerable residents\r\n-\tOpportunities for new planting\r\n-\tHot and very hot streets, as shown in thermal imaging \r\n-\tUseful Life Expectancy of existing trees\r\n-\tExisting canopy cover\r\n\r\nThis dataset shows the anticipated timeframe for tree planting in each street across the City of Melbourne. This timing is provisional and subject to change. The schedule for some streets may be moved forward or delayed by capital works, developments or renewal projects that impact on tree planting or survival. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Urban Forest Strategy and Precinct Plans, visit http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/sustainability/urbanforest/pages/urbanforest.aspx",

        "description": "Insect Records in the City of Melbourne from the Little Things that Run the City Project. This data identifies what individual species were found in the Little Things that Run the City Project and is not a count of all species recorded. This data was obtained from Luis Mata, a postdoctoral researcher at RMIT. The data is owned by the City of Melbourne and RMIT. The project started in October 2014 with the first survey of insects for this project in parks and gardens in the City of Melbourne. More surveys were conducted between January and March 2015. Insect species were sorted and identified from April to September 2015. This is the raw data for the report that was published in late 2016.\r\n\r\nSome records are lacking information on the species classifcation level, and may have the correct genus information accompanied with a number in the identification notes column - this donates species 1, 2, or 3 of that genus where the species could not be identfiifed. All records lack a species name as this was not provided to the City of Melbourne in the original dataset.",

        "description": "Melbourne BioBlitz is one of the City of Melbourne’s major citizen science programs, where experts and members of the community work together to discover, document, and learn about the species that call our city home. \r\n\r\nThe most recent Melbourne BioBlitz took place over 24 hours on 4 and 5 March 2016. During the BioBlitz 744 members of the public joined 27 activities which included spotting birds at Royal Park, identifying insects at Westgate Park, and searching for plants in the Fitzroy Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe City of Melbourne has analysed the data collected in past BioBlitzes and is now building a baseline dataset against which future changes in biodiversity can be measured and evaluated.",

        "description": "This dataset contains the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) from activities taking place within the geographic boundary of the City of Melbourne Local Government Area. \n\nThe City of Melbourne uses the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/greenhouse-gas-protocol-accounting-reporting-standard-cities\" target=\"_blank\">Global Protocol for communities (GPC)</a>  method to measure and report municipal greenhouse emissions. Emissions are reported annually through the <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a> platform, which is a requirement of Global Covenant of Mayors and C40 membership. \n\nEmission sources are broken down across the sectors: Stationary energy, Transportation and Waste. They are categorized by their \"scope\" which distinguishes between emissions that physically occur within the city (scope 1), from those that occur from the use of electricity and supplied by grids potentially crossing city boundaries (scope 2), from those that occur outside the city but are driven by activities taking place within the city’s boundaries (scope 3). All GHG emissions are presented in units of metric tonnes CO2 equivalent (tCO2e).\n \nIn cases where there are limitations on data availability notation keys have been used. NO indicates that an activity or process does not occur or exist within the city. IE signifies GHG emissions for this activity are presented in another category of the inventory. NE is used when emissions occur but have not been estimated or reported due to unavailability of data.\n\nPreparing and reporting this data helps us to understand where the city's emissions come from. It allows us to plan our emission reduction activities to take effective action to mitigate climate change.",

It can be easily mapped using the geometry column. \n\nTree canopy polygons have been derived by ArborCarbon from high-resolution airborne multispectral imagery. ArborCarbon collected this imagery using the ArborCam, a unique 11-band airborne multispectral camera system optimized for the accurate detection of vegetation and subtle changes in vegetation condition. \n\nThe high-resolution airborne imagery datasets were geometrically corrected and orthorectified using the City of Melbourne’s publicly available 2018 aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model supplied by the City. A Digital Surface Model was generated from the acquired imagery for the full extent of the City, enabling the stratification of vegetation into a range of height categories. All vegetation >3m above the ground was classified as canopy (excluding vegetation on building rooftops).",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a property level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and projections for energy consumption have been made for between 2016 and 2026, based on a business-as-usual scenario. It does not include the industrial sector.",

        "description": "This dataset contains survey data for bird species across various river and wetland locations in the City of Melbourne. Bird transect surveys were conducted by Ecology Australia at the following locations: Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Wildlife Sanctuary (1), Dynon Road, West Melbourne, Tidal Drain (2), Moonee Ponds Creek lower catchment near Racecourse Road, Kensington and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (3), Maribyrnong River near Newells Paddock and Dynon Road, West Melbourne (4), Royal Park Oak Street Wetland (5), and Stony Creek Backwash, Footscray (6). Surveys were undertaken during daylight hours and were repeated on various dates throughout February and March 2018. Bird surveys were conducted by completing transects along the waterbodies and identifying bird species and numbers. These surveys were undertaken to primarily track bird species richness at Site (1) with Site (3) existing as a reference site with comparable habitat characteristics.\n\nThis bird survey dataset includes the bird’s common name, scientific name, the corresponding Victorian Biodiversity Atlas Code, the date the survey was conducted, and the location of the survey (including the latitude and longitude). The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is managed by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and provides a list of species observations in Victoria. Each species has an identification ‘code’ number.\n\nPlease get in contact with the Urban Forest and Ecology Team (nature@melbourne.vic.gov.au) if you wish to view the full report by Ecology Australia or if you have any questions about the dataset.",

It is not energy consumption data captured by a meter, but modelled data based on building attributes such as building age, floor area etc. This data was provided by the CSIRO as a result of a study commissioned by IMAP Councils. The study was governed by a Grant Agreement between Councils and the CSIRO, which stated an intent for the data to be published. This specific dataset is presented at a block level scale. It includes both commercial and residential buildings and is a 2026 business-as-usual projection, relative to a 2011 baseline. It does not include the industrial sector.",
